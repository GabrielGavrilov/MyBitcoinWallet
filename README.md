# MyBitcoinWallet - A simple desktop Bitcoin wallet.

MyBitcoinWallet is a simple & beginner friendly bitcoin wallet with no strings attached to it. With most other desktop wallets, your crypto assets aren't truly "your" crypto assets. Most other desktop wallets will store your bitcoins in one giant bitcoin wallet vault, which could lead to a lot of issues. But with MyBitcoinWallet, your assets are truly stored in your given wallet address, allowing you to be the only person in control of your assets. With this feature, you'll be able to change desktop wallets with ease and no stress.
